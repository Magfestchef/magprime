Dear Returning Trusted Volunteers,

It's good to see you again, and I'm glad you are coming back. This is going to be a big year for us. We have made several changes this year and we are very excited about our new format. This year we have 4 returning Department Heads. David (aka English), Heather, Mrs.Chef and Chef. IF you have questions or need help, we are the ones you go to.

I am writing you to say how excited we are to have you return to work with us. First let me say you have impressed us with your dedication and willingness to do that work, even when it is not glamorous or plesant. Your hard work has helped us make this department a crucial part of Magfest and one of the most attractive reasons to volunteer. While this department may not receive much attention, we are very much the engine that keeps Magfest, and more importantly the people running it, going full speed. 

We are going to be experiencing our greatest numbers ever this year. Thanks to our efforts at awareness and streamlining our ordering process, we are expecting to see a significant uptick, even during our slowest meals. Thanks to the efforts of our Department Heads, we have revamped our menu and equipment to speed up and increase our production capacity. This will require a greater effor form us all to ensure we can meet the ambitious goals we have set for ourselves. We are trusting in you to help us reach these goals and make this our best Magfest ever.

We look forward to seeing you at Magfest.

The Department Heads,
Staff Suite, Magfest
