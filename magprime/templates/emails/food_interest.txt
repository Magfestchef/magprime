Hello {{ attendee.first_name }}!

Thank you for not only signing up to volunteer at {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}, but to volunteer with the Staff Suite. If you are confused as to why you are receiving this email, then allow me to explain. When you signed up to volunteer, you either checked any or specifically checked “Staff Suite” as a requested department to work in.

If you are not familiar with the Staff Suite, it’s part of the perks of volunteering. We are the ones who cook and provide the 3 meals a day, as well as snacks and drinks that keep magfest and it's staffers going strong. Voluntering for Staff Suite means you may be rwquired to perform the tasks we need to have done at the given time. Thes tasks could include badge checking, serving food, preparing and cooking food, cleaning and washing dishes, maintaining supplies, and other miscellaneous jobs as needed. We are always on the lookout for volunteers who are willing to put in the time and effort and make a significant contribution to this department and MAGFest as a whole.

Please note that you don't need to have any experience in food to work quite sucessfully with us. The best volunteers we have had over the years have simply come with a willing and energetic attitude and a drive to do what was needed. 

We look forward to working with you, if you have any questions please let us know!
