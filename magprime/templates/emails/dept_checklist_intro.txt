You are receiving this email because you are listed as a MAGFest Department Head of the {{ attendee.assigned_depts_labels.0 }} department.

While you might not be the actual Department Head, but one of many within your department, you are on the list to receive the Department Head Checklist.

This means that you have access in Rams/Uber to go to:
{{ c.URL_BASE }}/dept_checklist/index
and complete the items on that Checklist.

These are all steps that are needed in order for your volunteers to sign up for shifts, for your department to get the MPoints that you need, for your staffers that are qualified to get into MAGFest Crash space (especially those coming early or staying late), etc.

This list will also include a form from Tech Ops to define what technical/electronic gear you need in your department for MAGFest. This is currently not in the online version but will uploaded shortly.

This also includes signage and office supplies that you might need for the MAGFest office team to make your department run more efficiently.
